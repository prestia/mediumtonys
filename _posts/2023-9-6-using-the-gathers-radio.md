## Intro

As far as I can tell, there were two main Gathers head units available in the Honda Beat. The GXC-8200SF and the GXC-8290SF.

### GXC-8200SF

The GXC-8200SF was the base model radio and produced 2-channel audio at 20W per channel. You likely have this head unit if your car didn't come with dash speakers and a subwoofer (known as "Sky Sound").

### GXC-8290SF

The premium radio was the GXC-8290SF. This unit produces 4-channel audio at 30W per channel. If you have the Sky Sound speakers, this is probably your unit.

### Gathers 20th Anniversary Edition

Around 2011, Honda released [a new Gathers head unit](https://www.honda.co.jp/ACCESS/beat/audio/) for the Beat with an LCD screen, aux input, USB input, and support for iPods and iPhones. This unit is a drop-in replacement for the GXC-8290SF and is capable of powering the stock Sky Sound speakers. These units are rare and increasingly expensive.

### Scope of this guide

This guide will cover setting up and using the premium GXC-8290SF unit. However, much of it will also apply to the GXC-8200SF. As for the "20th Anniversary" head unit, I really have no idea.

The guide is divided into 5 sections:

1. [General usage](#general-usage)
2. [Radio](#radio)
3. [Cassette](#cassette)
4. [CD changer](#cd-changer)
5. [Error codes](#error-codes)

Please [reach out](mailto:tony@mediumtonysgarage.com) if you have an info on the 20th Anniversary head unit or feel free to [edit this post directly](https://github.com/prestia/mediumtonys/blob/main/_posts/2023-9-6-using-the-gathers-radio.md).

Yes. Pressing the `auto volume control button` will illuminate the `auto volume control display` and allow your car to automatically increase and decrease volume according to vehicle speed.

Pushing the `auto volume control button` again will turn off the `auto volume control display` and return to volume that was set before enabling the feature.

### How do I temporarily turn down the volume?
Press the `mute button` to significantly reduce the volume. Press the `mute button` again to return to the previous volume.

Note that the mute button _does not_ completely eliminate sound.

### How can I change the sound balance?
Pressing the `loudness button` will illuminate the `loudness display` and change the EQ settings to emphasize treble and bass, with the goal of making music sound more dynamic at low volume. 

Pressing the `loudness button` again will turn off the `loudness display` and return your EQ to a neutral setting.

### How can I manually adjust the EQ settings?
Pressing the `audio mode button` will cycle between:

* `LOW/HI` (`stereo mix display`).
If you don't touch another buttons for 5 seconds, you'll exit this adjustment mode.

Using the `+/- buttons` will adjust settings as follows:

| Setting | `- button` | `+ button` |
|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|  BAS    | Decrease bass | Increase bass |
|  TRE    | Decrease treble | Increase treble |
