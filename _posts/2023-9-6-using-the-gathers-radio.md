## Intro

As far as I can tell, there were two main Gathers head units available in the Honda Beat. The GXC-8200SF and the GXC-8290SF.

The GXC-8200SF was the base model radio and produced 2-channel audio at 20W per channel. You likely have this head unit if your car didn't come with dash speakers and a subwoofer (known as "Sky Sound").

The premium radio was the GXC-8290SF (pictured above). This unit produces 4-channel audio at 30W per channel. If you the Sky Sounds speakers, this is probably your unit.

Around 2011, Honda released [a new Gathers head unit](https://www.honda.co.jp/ACCESS/beat/audio/) for the Beat with an LCD screen, aux input, USB input, and support for iPods and iPhones. This head unit is a drop-in replacement for the GXC-8290SF and is capable of powering the stock Sky Sound speakers. These units are rare and increasingly expensive.

This guide will cover setting and using the premium GXC-8290SF unit. However, much of it will also apply to the GXC-8200SF. As for the "20th Anniversary" head unit, I really have no idea.
