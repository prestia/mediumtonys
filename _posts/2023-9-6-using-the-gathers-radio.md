## Intro

As far as I can tell, there were two main Gathers head units available in the Honda Beat. The GXC-8200SF and the GXC-8290SF.

### GXC-8200SF

The GXC-8200SF was the base model radio and produced 2-channel audio at 20W per channel. You likely have this head unit if your car didn't come with dash speakers and a subwoofer (known as "Sky Sound").

### GXC-8290SF

The premium radio was the GXC-8290SF. This unit produces 4-channel audio at 30W per channel. If you have the Sky Sound speakers, this is probably your unit.

### Gathers 20th Anniversary Edition

Around 2011, Honda released [a new Gathers head unit](https://www.honda.co.jp/ACCESS/beat/audio/) for the Beat with an LCD screen, aux input, USB input, and support for iPods and iPhones. This unit is a drop-in replacement for the GXC-8290SF and is capable of powering the stock Sky Sound speakers. These units are rare and increasingly expensive.

### Scope of this guide

This guide will cover setting up and using the premium GXC-8290SF unit. However, much of it will also apply to the GXC-8200SF. As for the "20th Anniversary" head unit, I really have no idea.

The guide is divided into 5 sections:

1. [General usage](#general-usage)
2. [Radio](#radio)
3. [Cassette](#cassette)
4. [CD changer](#cd-changer)
5. [Error codes](#error-codes)

Please [reach out](mailto:tony@mediumtonysgarage.com) if you have an info on the 20th Anniversary head unit or feel free to [edit this post directly](https://github.com/prestia/mediumtonys/blob/main/_posts/2023-9-6-using-the-gathers-radio.md).

### How do I turn on the head unit?
Push the `power button` when the car is running or the key is in the ACC or ON position.

### How do I see the time?
Push the `clock button` to display the time.

### How do I set the time?
While holding the `clock button`, press the `<< button` to adjust the hour and the `>> button` to adjust the minute.

### How do I adjust the volume?
Tap the `volume up/down button` to adjust the volume by a single step. Hold the `volume up/down button` to continuously adjust the volume. Volume will be reflected in the `volume display` and the `bar-level display`.

### Can I automatically adjust the volume based on vehicle speed?
Yes. Pressing the `auto volume control button` will illuminate the `auto volume control display` and allow your car to automatically increase and decrease volume in line with vehicle speed. Pushing the `auto volume control button` again will turn off the `auto volume control display` and return you to volume that was set before enabling auto volume control.

### How do I temporarily turn down the volume?
Press the `mute button` to significantly reduce the volume. Press the `mute button` again to return to the previous volume. Note that the mute button _does not_ completely eliminate sound.

### How can I change the sound balance?
Pressing the `loudness button` will illuminate the `loudness display` and change the EQ settings to emphasize treble and bass, with the goal of making music sound more dynamic at low volume. Pressing the `loudness button` again will turn off the `loudness display` and return your EQ to a neutral setting.

### How can I manually adjust the EQ settings?
Pressing the `audio mode button` will cycle between `BAS` (`bass dispaly`), `TRE` (`treble display`), `LEFT/RIGHT` (`left speaker display`/`right speaker display`), and `LOW/HI` (`stereo mix display`). If you don't touch another buttons for 5 seconds, you'll exit this adjustment mode.

When in the adjustment mode, use the `+/- buttons` to change settings as follows:

| Setting | `- button` | `+ button` |
|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|  BAS    | Decrease bass | Increase bass |
|  TRE    | Decrease treble | Increase treble |
| LEFT/RIGHT | Shift audio balance left | Shift audio balance right |
| LOW/HI |  Shift balance to the full Sky Sound setup | Shift balance to the stereo setup |

### How do I start and stop the CD changer?
Pressing the `CD button` will turn on the CD player. Pressing the `CD button` while the CD player is already active will pause the music and activate the `pause display`.

### How do I change discs?
Press the `1-6 buttons` to select the corresponding disc in  your CD changer and it will automatically start playing.

If no CD changer is connected, the `disc display` will blink. If the CD magazine is empty, the head unit will display Err7.

### How do I skip tracks and seek within a song?
Press the `set button` to switch between skipping tracks and seeking.

When the `set display` is illuminated, the `<< button` will go back a track and the `>> button` will skip ahead a track. Holding either the `<< button` or the `>> button` will continuous skip tracks.

When the `set display` is off, holding the `<< button` will rewind the track and holding the `>> button` will fast-forward the track.

### How do I quickly sample the songs on a disc?
Pressing the `scan button` will illuminate the `scan display` and start playing the first 10 seconds of each song in order. If you press the `scan button` again, the `scan display` will turn off and you'll begin listening to the track normally.

### How do I put a song on repeat?
Press the `repeat button` to illuminate the `repeat display` and continuously play the same song. Pressing the `repeat button` again will turn off the `repeat display` and return to sequential playback of the disc.
