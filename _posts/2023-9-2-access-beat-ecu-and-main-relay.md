## Intro
This guide will walk you through the process of accessing the ECU and main relay in your Honda Beat. These sensitive electronic components are regularly exposed to extreme heat because they're located close to the engine. Over time, this can lead to failure of one or both components. The most common issues are blown capacitors in the ECU or cracked solder joints in the main relay.

If you have trouble starting your Beat when it's warm, it's probably time to repair or replace the main relay.

You may also want to access the ECU and main relay to do some preventative maintenance, like relocating them under the passenger seat or installing heat shielding.

Accessing the main relay is also useful if you want to install a kill switch to make it somewhat less likely that your Beat will get stolen.

## Parts & tools
1. Stubby JIS2 screwdriver (You'll need a stubby screwdriver to undo fasteners behind the passenger seat. Alternatively, you could remove the seat.)
2. 10 mm socket
3. Plastic pry tools

## Instructions

### Step 0: Come up with a plan for storing fasteners

You're going to remove a lot of tiny fasteners before this project is over, and some of them can only be purchsed in Japan. Before you start taking things apart, you should come up with a plan for storing them.

You could use a small tray (like this 3D-printed one on the left) or even the ashtray in your Beat:

My wife is an absolute genius and changed my life one day. She brought a [closet jewelery organizer](https://www.amazon.com/MISSLO-Dual-sided-Organizer-Necklace-Bracelet/dp/B08GX889W4/) out to the garage along with a small pad of paper:

I now use this every time I work on a car. Whenever I remove a part, I put all of the fasteners in a pouch and label it with the part, fastener size, and any other relevant information. I've never lost another bolt or ended a job with extra hardware.

### Step 1: Remove the subwoofer/cassette storage

Depending on how your Beat is optioned, you'll either have cassette storage or a subwoofer mounted between the seats. There are 4 JIS screws holding this in place. Two on each side:

If you have the cassette storage, you can remove this piece from the car. If you have the subwoofer, you'll either have to disconnect the wiring or lift the entire unit and rest it between the seats.

I have the subwoofer, so you'll see this piece resting in the middle throughout the tutorial.

### Aside: Why not clean your Beat?

Your Beat is 30+ years old at this point. It's probably accumulated some gunk and grime in odd places. Now's a great time to start cleaning some of these plastic panels as you remove them from the car.

### Step 2: Remove/loosen the side trim pieces
