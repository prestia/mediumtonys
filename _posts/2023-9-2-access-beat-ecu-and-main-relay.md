## Intro
This guide will walk you through the process of accessing the ECU and main relay in your Honda Beat. The Beat's ECU and main relay are regularly exposed to extreme heat because they're located close to the engine. Over time, this can lead to failure of one or both components. The most common issues are blown capacitors in the ECU or cracked solder joints in the main relay.

If you have trouble starting your Beat when it's warm, it's probably time to repair or replace the main relay.

You may also want to access the ECU and main relay to do some preventative maintenance, like relocating them under the passenger seat or installing heat shielding.

Accessing the main relay is also useful if you want to install a kill switch to make it somewhat less likely that your Beat will get stolen.

## Parts & tools
1. Stubby JIS2 screwdriver (You'll need this to undo fasteners behind the passenger seat. If you don't have a stubby screw driver, you could remove the seat.)
2. 10 mm socket
3. Plastic pry tools

## Instructions

### Step 1: Remove
