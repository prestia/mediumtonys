## Details
This slicktop 320i was originally imported from Italy by a dealer prior to COVID. It's had two prior U.S. owners. The first runs Dynasport in Portland, OR; the second was a customer of Dynasport who purchased the car and sold it to me. All modifications happened prior to my ownership except for the engine swap. The original M20B20 was replaced with an M54B30 from an e46 330i.
