The part number for the oil filter is #15400-PLM-A02 and should be pretty widely available in the U.S. Honda recommends replacement every 20,000 km (≈12,500 mi).

### Transmission oil

Honda recommends 10w30 oil or Honda MTF. Replacement is recommended every 40,000 km (≈25,000 mi).

### Coolant

The Beat uses 4.7 liters of of coolant (50% distilled water and 50% stndard Honda Blue) and should be replaced every 2 years.

### Brake fluid

DOT 3 or DOT 4

### Clutch fluid

DOT 3 brake fluid

### Gasoline

The Honda Beat runs on "regular" Japanese gas. Regular gas in Japan is >= 89 RON, which is roughly 85 octane in the U.S.

## Timing belt

Honda recommends that the Beat's timing belt is changed every 100,000 km (≈62,000 mi). However, a broken timing belt can lead to catastrophic damage to your hard-to-source 3-cylinder engine.

As a result, most Beat owners recommend changing the timing belt as soon as possible if you don't have records of it being recently changed. When changing the timing belt, you should also change the water pump, idler pulley, and tensioner pulley.

## Spark plugs

Recommendation is NGK BKR6E-11 or Denso K20PR-U11.

Plugs should be torqued to 13-15 lb.ft. Gap is 0.030 +/- 0.005.

## Air filter

Honda recommends replacing the air filter every 40,000 km (≈25,000 mi).
