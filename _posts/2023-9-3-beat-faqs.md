## Fluids

### Engine oil

Generally, the Beat takes 3 liters of 10w30 oil. Though Honda recommends the following weights depending on outside temperature:

The part number for the oil filter is #15400-PLM-A02 and should be pretty widely available in the U.S. because it was used on other period Hondas. Honda recommends replacement every 20,000 km (≈12,500 mi).

### Transmission oil

Honda recommends 10w30 oil or Honda MTF. Replacement is recommended every 40,000 km (≈25,000 mi).

### Coolant

The Beat uses 4.7 liters of of coolant (50% distilled water and 50% standard Honda Blue) and should be replaced every 2 years.

### Brake fluid

DOT 3 or DOT 4

### Clutch fluid

DOT 3 brake fluid

### Gasoline

The Honda Beat runs on "regular" Japanese gas. Regular gas in Japan is >= 89 RON, which is roughly 85 octane in the U.S.

## Timing belt

Honda recommends that the Beat's timing belt is changed every 100,000 km (≈62,000 mi). However, a broken timing belt can lead to catastrophic damage to your hard-to-source 3-cylinder engine.

As a result, most Beat owners recommend changing the timing belt as soon as possible if you don't have records of it being recently changed. When changing the timing belt, you should also change the water pump, idler pulley, and tensioner pulley.

## Spark plugs

Recommendation is NGK BKR6E-11 or Denso K20PR-U11.

Plugs should be torqued to 13-15 lb.ft. Gap is 0.030 +/- 0.005.

## Air filter

Honda recommends replacing the air filter every 40,000 km (≈25,000 mi).

## Tires

* Front: 155/65R13 73H
* Rear: 165/60R14 74H

Good luck finding these locally!

## How can I tell if my Beat has a limited slip differential?

There's quite a bit of misinformation on the web about which Beats came with LSDs from the factory. My Version Z did not, but I suspect most of the PP1-110 models did.

In any event, it's incredibly easy to test whether your Beat currently has an LSD:

1. Put your Beat on a lift or chock the front wheels and jack up the back.
2. Disengage the parking brake.
3. Put the car in first gear.
4. Put on some short shorts.
5. Spin one of the back wheels as if the car is driving forward.

If the opposite wheel moves in the opposite direction, then you don't have a limited slip differential:
